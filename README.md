# Machine-Learning

Welcome to my repository! 

Here, I am sharing my notes and code from various machine learning courses I've taken on Alura and CodeAcademy. I am particularly excited about the topics of TreeClassifiers and DeepLearning, which I found to be the most engaging and informative. As I continue to explore the field of machine learning, I hope to share more of my learning journey with you through this repository. 

Thank you for visiting and enjoy exploring my notes and code.
